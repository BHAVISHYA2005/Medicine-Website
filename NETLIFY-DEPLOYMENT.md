# 🚀 Deploy to Netlify via Website (Step-by-Step)

## Your project is now ready for deployment! 

### Step 1: Go to Netlify
1. Open your browser and go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up or log in with your GitHub account

### Step 2: Create New Site
1. Click **"New site from Git"** button
2. Choose **"GitHub"** as your Git provider
3. Authorize Netlify to access your repositories

### Step 3: Configure Repository
1. Find and select your **"Medicine-Website"** repository
2. Select the **main** branch

### Step 4: Configure Build Settings
**IMPORTANT:** Use these exact settings:

- **Base directory:** `Frontend/medicine-frontend`
- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Publish directory:** `dist/medicine-frontend/browser`

### Step 5: Deploy
1. Click **"Deploy site"**
2. Wait for the build to complete (this may take 2-5 minutes)
3. Your site will be live at a random Netlify URL (like `https://amazing-site-name-123456.netlify.app`)

## 🎉 That's it! Your frontend is now live!

## Next Steps After Deployment

### 1. Custom Domain (Optional)
- In your Netlify dashboard, go to **Site settings** → **Domain management**
- Add your custom domain or use the free Netlify subdomain

### 2. Deploy Your Backend
Since your frontend is now live, you'll need to deploy your .NET backend:

**Recommended Backend Hosting:**
- **Railway.app** (Easiest for .NET)
- **Azure App Service** (Microsoft's platform)
- **Render.com** (Good free tier)

### 3. Update API URL
After deploying your backend:
1. Update `Frontend/medicine-frontend/src/app/environment/environment.prod.ts`
2. Replace `https://your-backend-api-url.com/api` with your actual backend URL
3. Commit and push changes
4. Netlify will automatically rebuild and redeploy

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails:
1. Check the build logs in Netlify dashboard
2. Ensure your `netlify.toml` file is in the `Frontend/medicine-frontend` directory
3. Verify the build settings match exactly as shown above

### If Site Loads but Shows Errors:
- This is expected! Your backend isn't deployed yet
- Deploy your backend first, then update the API URL

## 📱 Current Status
- ✅ Frontend: Ready for deployment
- ⏳ Backend: Needs to be deployed
- ⏳ Database: Will be configured with backend deployment

## 🆘 Need Help?
- Check Netlify build logs for specific errors
- Ensure all files are committed and pushed to GitHub
- Verify the build directory structure matches expectations

**Your Netlify deployment should work perfectly with the current setup!** 🎊
