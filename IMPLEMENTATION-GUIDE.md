## ðŸ“‹ Feature Branch Strategy

For each major feature, use this workflow with Pull Request (PR) integration:

```bash
# 1. Start new feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/user-authentication
git commit -m "feat(auth): scaffold authentication module structure"

# 2. Implement core functionality with incremental commits
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement user registration endpoint"
git commit -m "feat(auth): add password hashing and validation"
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement JWT token generation"

# 3. Add frontend integration
git commit -m "feat(auth): create login/register components"
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement auth service and guards"
git commit -m "feat(auth): add user authentication state management"

# 4. Testing and refinement
git commit -m "test(auth): add comprehensive authentication tests"
git commit -m "fix(auth): resolve token expiration handling"
git commit -m "docs(auth): update API documentation for auth endpoints"

# 5. Push feature branch and create Pull Request
git push origin feat/user-authentication

# 6. Create Pull Request via GitHub/GitLab interface:
#    - Navigate to your repository on GitHub
#    - Click "Compare & pull request" for your feature branch
#    - Fill out PR template with:
#      * Clear description of changes
#      * Testing instructions
#      * Screenshots/demos if applicable
#      * Link to related issues

# 7. PR Review Process:
#    - Wait for CI/CD checks to pass (build, tests, linting)
#    - Request reviews from team members
#    - Address reviewer feedback with additional commits
#    - Ensure all conversations are resolved

# 8. Merge via Pull Request (after approval and CI success):
#    - Use "Squash and merge" for clean history
#    - Or "Create merge commit" to preserve feature branch history
#    - Delete feature branch after successful merge

# 9. Clean up local environment
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feat/user-authentication
```

### PR Best Practices:

**Pull Request Template:**
```markdown

- âœ… All tests pass
- âœ… Code linting/formatting checks
- âœ… Security vulnerability scans
- âœ… No merge conflicts with main branch

### GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for automated testing:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  frontend-tests:
    name: Frontend Build & Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
        cache-dependency-path: Frontend/medicine-frontend/package-lock.json
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      working-directory: Frontend/medicine-frontend
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Run tests
      working-directory: Frontend/medicine-frontend
      run: npm run test -- --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless
    
    - name: Build for production
      working-directory: Frontend/medicine-frontend
      run: npm run build

  backend-tests:
    name: Backend Build & Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
      with:
        dotnet-version: '8.0.x'
    
    - name: Restore dependencies
      working-directory: Backend/MedicineWebsite
      run: dotnet restore
    
    - name: Build
      working-directory: Backend/MedicineWebsite
      run: dotnet build --no-restore
    
    - name: Test
      working-directory: Backend/MedicineWebsite
      run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal

  security-scan:
    name: Security Vulnerability Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
      uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
      with:
        scan-type: 'fs'
        scan-ref: '.'
```

**Required CI Status Checks:**
- All tests must pass before PR can be merged
- Build must be successful for both frontend and backend
- Security scans must complete without critical vulnerabilities
- Code coverage should meet minimum threshold (e.g., 80%)
